    abstract: '  Abstract The Cox proportional hazards model is one of the most frequently
      used estimators in duration            (survival) analysis. Because it is estimated
      using only the observed durations’ rank ordering, typical            quantities
      of interest used to communicate results of the Cox model come from the hazard
      function            (e.g., hazard ratios or percentage changes in the hazard
      rate). These quantities are substantively vague            and difficult for
      many audiences of research to understand. We introduce a suite of methods in
      the R            package coxed to address these problems. The package allows
      researchers to calculate duration-based            quantities from Cox model
      results, such as the expected duration (or survival time) given covariate            values
      and marginal changes in duration for a specified change in a covariate. These
      duration-based            quantities often match better with researchers’ substantive
      interests and are easily understood by most            readers. We describe
      the methods and illustrate use of the package.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Spatial statistics for infectious diseases are important
      because the spatial and temporal            scale over which transmission operates
      determine the dynamics of disease spread. Many methods            for quantifying
      the distribution and clustering of spatial point patterns have been developed
      (e.g. K           function and pair correlation function) and are routinely
      applied to infectious disease case occurrence            data. However, these
      methods do not explicitly account for overlapping chains of transmission and            require
      knowledge of the underlying population distribution, which can be limiting when
      analyzing            epidemic case occurrence data. Therefore, we developed
      two novel spatial statistics that account for            these effects to estimate:
      1) the mean of the spatial transmission kernel, and 2) the τ-statistic, a measure            of
      global clustering based on pathogen subtype. We briefly introduce these statistics
      and show how to            implement them using the IDSpatialStats R package.'

    author:

    bibauthor: David P. Hofmeyr and Nicos G. Pavlidis
    abstract: '  Abstract This paper presents the R package PPCI which implements
      three recently proposed projection            pursuit methods for clustering.
      The methods are unified by the approach of defining an optimal            hyperplane
      to separate clusters, and deriving a projection index whose optimiser is the
      vector normal            to this separating hyperplane. Divisive hierarchical
      clustering algorithms that can detect clusters            defined in different
      subspaces are readily obtained by recursively bi-partitioning the data through
      such            hyperplanes. Projecting onto the vector normal to the optimal
      hyperplane enables visualisations of the            data that can be used to
      validate the partition at each level of the cluster hierarchy. PPCI also provides            a
      simplified framework in which the clustering models can be modified in an interactive
      manner.            Extensions to problems involving clusters which are not linearly
      separable, and to the problem of            finding maximum hard margin hyperplanes
      for clustering are also discussed.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Several methods for creating classifiers based on rules
      discovered via association rule            mining have been proposed in the
      literature. These classifiers are called associative classifiers and            the
      best-known algorithm is Classification Based on Associations (CBA). Interestingly,
      only very few            implementations are available and, until recently,
      no implementation was available for R. Now, three            packages provide

    abstract: '  Abstract Regular expressions are powerful tools for manipulating

    abstract: '  Abstract Nonparametric statistical inference methods for a modern

      experiments are essential for research. While existing approaches            that
      rely on specific distributional assumptions of the data (multivariate normality
      and/or equal            covariance matrices) are implemented in statistical
      software packages, there is a need for user-friendly            software that

      ARCH models is provided.           In particular, we distinguish between three
      different spatial ARCH-type models. In addition to           the original definition
      of ?, we introduce an logarithmic spatial ARCH model in this paper. For           this

      addition, we           consider a new complex-valued definition of the spatial

      From a practical point of view, the use of the R-package spGARCH is           demonstrated.
      To be precise, we show how the proposed spatial ARCH models can be simulated           and
      summarize the variety of spatial models, which can be estimated by the estimation

    abstract: '  Abstract Researchers and data-analysts often use the linear regression
      model for descriptive, predictive,            and inferential purposes. This
      model relies on a set of assumptions that, when not satisfied, yields            biased
      results and noisy estimates. A common problem that can be solved in many ways
      – use of less            restrictive methods (e.g. generalized linear regression
      models or non-parametric methods ), variance            corrections or transformations
      of the response variable just to name a few. We focus on the latter            option
      as it allows to keep using the simple and well-known linear regression model.
      The list of            transformations proposed in the literature is long and
      varies according to the problem they aim to            solve. Such diversity
      can leave analysts lost and confused. We provide a framework implemented            as
      an R-package, trafo, to help selecting a suitable transformation depending on
      the user and data            needs. The package trafo contains a collection

    bibauthor: Wadim Djatschenko
    abstract: '  Abstract The purpose of this paper is to introduce the R package
      BondValuation for the analysis of            large datasets of fixed coupon
      bonds. The conceptual heterogeneity of fixed coupon bonds traded            in
      the global markets imposes a high degree of complexity on their comparative
      analysis. Contrary            to baseline fixed income theory, in practice,
      most bonds feature coupon period irregularities. In            addition, there
      are a multitude of day count methods that determine the interest accrual, the
      cash            flows and the discount factors used in bond valuation. Several
      R packages, e.g., fBonds, RQuantLib,            and YieldCurve, provide tools
      for fixed income analysis. Nevertheless, none of them is capable            of
      evaluating bonds featuring irregular first and/or final coupon periods, and
      neither provides            adequate coverage of day count conventions currently
      used in the global bond markets. The R package            BondValuation closes
      this gap using the generalized valuation methodology presented in ?.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Methods based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
      fingerprinting are in the            forefront among several techniques being
      proposed for indoor positioning. This paper introduces            the R package
      ipft, which provides algorithms and utility functions for indoor positioning
      using            fingerprinting techniques. These functions are designed for
      manipulation of RSSI fingerprint data            sets, estimation of positions,
      comparison of the performance of different positioning models, and            graphical
      visualization of data. Well-known machine learning algorithms are implemented
      in this            package to perform analysis and estimations over RSSI data
      sets. The paper provides a description            of these algorithms and functions,
      as well as examples of its use with real data. The ipft package            provides
      a base that we hope to grow into a comprehensive library of fingerprinting-based
      indoor            positioning methodologies.'

    abstract: '  Abstract In the context of regression with a large number of explanatory
      variables, Cox and Battey            (2017) emphasize that if there are alternative
      reasonable explanations of the data that are statistically            indistinguishable,
      one should aim to specify as many of these explanations as is feasible. The
      standard            practice, by contrast, is to report a single model effective
      for prediction. The present paper illustrates            the R implementation
      of the new ideas in the package HCmodelSets, using simple reproducible            examples
      and real data. Results of some simulation experiments are also reported.'

    bibtitle: Facets of R
    author: John M. Chambers
    bibauthor: John M. Chambers
    landing: '2009'
    abstract: We are seeing today a widespread, and welcome, tendency for non-computer-specialists
      among statisticians and others to write collections of R functions that organize
      and communicate their work. Along with the flood of software sometimes comes
      an attitude that one need only learn, or teach, a sort of basic how-to-write-the-function
      level of R programming, beyond which most of the detail is unimportant or can
      be absorbed without much discussion. As delusions go, this one is not very objectionable
      if it encourages participation. Nevertheless, a delusion it is. In fact, functions
      are only one of a variety of important facets that R has acquired by intent
      or circumstance during the three-plus decades of the history of the software
      and of its predecessor S. To create valuable and trustworthy software using
      R often requires an understanding of some of these facets and their interrelations.
      This paper identifies six facets, discussing where they came from, how they
      support or conflict with each other, and what implications they have for the
      future of programming with R.

    abstract: 'Open source software (OSS) is typically created in a decentralized
      self-organizing process by a community of developers having the same or similar
      interests (see the famous essay by ?). A key factor for the success of OSS over
      the last two decades is the Internet: Developers who rarely meet face-to-face
      can employ new means of communication, both for rapidly writing and deploying
      software (in the spirit of Linus Torvald’s “release early, release often paradigm”).
      Therefore, many tools emerged that assist a collaborative software development
      process, including in particular tools for source code management (SCM) and
      version control.'

    abstract: The concept of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and the Hilbert spectrum
      (HS) has been developed rapidly in many disciplines of science and engineering
      since Huang et al. (1998) invented EMD. The key feature of EMD is to decompose
      a signal into so-called intrinsic mode function (IMF). Furthermore, the Hilbert
      spectral analysis of intrinsic mode functions provides frequency information
      evolving with time and quantifies the amount of variation due to oscillation
      at different time scales and time locations. In this article, we introduce an
      R package called EMD (Kim and Oh, 2008) that performs oneand twodimensional
      EMD and HS.

      experimental design is essential for reliable statistical inference, and sample
      size has a crucial role in experimental design. Because microarray experiments
      are rather costly, it is important to have an adequate sample size that will
      achieve a desired power without wasting resources.

    abstract: Statistical, data manipulation, and presentation tools make R an ideal
      integrated package for research in the fields of health policy and healthcare
      management and evaluation. However, the technical documentation accompanying
      most data sets used by researchers in these fields does not include syntax examples
      for analysts to make the transition from another statistical package to R. This
      paper describes the steps required to import health policy data into R, to prepare
      that data for analysis using the two most common complex survey variance calculation
      techniques, and to produce the principal set of statistical estimates sought
      by health policy researchers. Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel
      Survey Household Component (MEPS-HC), this paper outlines complex survey data
      analysis techniques in R, with side-by-side comparisons to the SAS, Stata, and
      SUDAAN statistical software packages.

      Its findFn function accesses Jonathan Baron’s R Site Search database and returns
      the matches in a data frame of class "findFn", which can be further manipulated
      by other sos functions to produce, for example, an Excel file that starts with
      a summary sheet that makes it relatively easy to prioritize alternative packages
      for further study. As such, it provides a very powerful way to do a literature
      search for functions and packages relevant to a particular topic of interest
      and could become virtually mandatory for authors of new packages or papers in
      publications such as The R Journal and the Journal of Statistical Software.
